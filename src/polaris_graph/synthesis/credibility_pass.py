"""I-cred-012 (#1162) — credibility-analysis pass ORCHESTRATOR (the activation chain).

Pure orchestrator that runs the committed P4→P3→P2→P5→P6 redesign chain over the generator's EFFECTIVE
evidence pool and returns the disclosure inputs (``credibility_by_evidence``, ``origin_by_evidence``,
``claims``, ``edges``, ``weight_mass``). The sweep runner calls it under the master slate
``PG_SWEEP_CREDIBILITY_REDESIGN``; OFF ⇒ not invoked ⇒ byte-identical. ADVISORY only: ``strict_verify`` +
the 4-role D8 release policy stay the ONLY binding gates — nothing here keeps/drops a sentence or flips
release.

FAIL-LOUD (the drb_72 silent-downgrade lesson, locked in the I-cred-012 architecture iter-1/4 resolutions):
a dead production judge (P2 ``judge_error``) or a row missing ``evidence_id`` ABORTS the pass
(``CredibilityPassError``) rather than degrading to a false-green advisory. The activation orchestrator
escalates the modules' OFFLINE fail-soft into a hard abort.

Order (locked): P4 copied-annotated rows (fail-loud on missing eid) → P3 supersession → P2 score
(fail-loud on judge_error) → POST-P3 credibility = P2 × P3 multiplier (certainty carried) → P5 claim graph
→ P6 weight-mass over the POST-P3 judgments. P10 dissent + the M-52 effective-pool hoist + the P8
render-site wrapper are the per-hook sub-issues; this module is the chain core they consume.
