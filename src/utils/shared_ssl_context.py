"""Process-wide shared TLS verification context for httpx clients.

BUG 3 — X509 SSL race (Q76 + Q78-first run-killer). Concurrent httpx client
construction on the verify/judge path (per-thread entailment clients +
parallel distill + parallel verify) crashed with::

    ssl.SSLError: [X509] PEM lib (_ssl.c:4166)

This is the known CPython/OpenSSL race: httpx's default ``verify=True`` makes
EVERY client build call ``ssl.create_default_context(cafile=certifi.where())``
-> ``load_verify_locations``, and concurrent PEM parses corrupt the shared
OpenSSL X509 parse state.

Fix: build ONE ``ssl.SSLContext`` ONCE (guarded by a ``threading.Lock`` at
first use) and pass that SAME validated context as ``verify=<ctx>`` to every
httpx client on the concurrent path. httpx then takes its
``create_ssl_context`` ``else: ctx = verify`` branch and NEVER re-parses the
PEM bundle, so concurrent client construction can no longer race the parser.

HARD CONSTRAINT — TLS verification stays ENABLED. This module NEVER uses
``verify=False``. It replicates httpx's exact ``verify is True`` precedence
(``SSL_CERT_FILE`` -> ``SSL_CERT_DIR`` -> ``certifi.where()``) via
``ssl.create_default_context`` (which yields ``verify_mode=CERT_REQUIRED`` and
``check_hostname=True``), so the shared context performs IDENTICAL real
certificate checking to a default per-client context. It only SHARES one
already-validated context instead of re-parsing the bundle per build.
Faithfulness-neutral: nothing about the verify/judge VERDICTS changes — only
the transport-layer TLS context is shared.

A CPython ``ssl.SSLContext`` is explicitly safe to share across threads and
across multiple connections, which is exactly why one shared instance is the
correct fix rather than a workaround.
